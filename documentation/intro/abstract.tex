\section*{Abstract}
\thispagestyle{nonum}

The goal of this Master Thesis is to co-design architectural and
microarchitectural extensions of at least one space processor such as Cobham
Gaisler's LEON3 (SPARC v8 based) or NOEL (RISC-V based), in order to increase
its performance capabilities for AI processing with a low hardware cost. The
architectural changes include the extension of the ISA with short SIMD
instructions which operate over the existing register file including also
predication capabilities. In the microarchitectural side, the processor design
will be converted to static superscalar featuring predication. The design
decisions will be driven by an analysis of AI processing software and the
proposal will be implemented in VHDL. Finally, compiler support will be added to
take advantage of the proposed hardware features.
